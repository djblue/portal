# portal

A clojure tool to navigate through your data.

## Client

[![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djblue/portal/master/resources/screenshot.png)](http://djblue.github.io/portal/)

The portal UI can be used to inspect values of various shapes and sizes.
It will only show you one level at a time and clicking an item will
navigate you into that item. Simple values (`"hello, world"`, `:a`, `1`,
`true`) resolve to themselves, while compound values (`[]`, `{}`, `#{}`)
will contain their elements.

There are currently three viewers to see values: coll, map and table.
Coll supports any collection, while map only supports maps and the table
only supports list of maps.

The UX will probably evolve over time and user feedback is welcome!

## API Usage

To start a repl with portal, run the clojure cli with:

```bash
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {djblue/portal {:mvn/version "0.3.1"}}}'
```

or for a **web** clojurescript repl, do:

```bash
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {djblue/portal {:mvn/version "0.3.1"}
                    org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.758"}}}' \
    -m cljs.main
```

or for a **node** clojurescript repl, do:

```bash
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {djblue/portal {:mvn/version "0.3.1"}
                    org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.758"}}}' \
    -m cljs.main -re node
```

then try the portal api with the following commands:

```clojure
;; for node and jvm
(require '[portal.api :as p])

;; for web
;; NOTE: you might need to enable popups for the portal ui to work in the
;; browser.
(require '[portal.web :as p])



(p/open) ; Open a new inspector

(p/tap) ; Add portal as a tap> target

(tap> :hello) ; Start tapping out values

(p/clear) ; Clear all values

(tap> :world) ; Tap out more values

(p/close) ; Close the inspector when done
```

### Themes

There are currently three built-in themes:

- [`:portal.colors/nord`](https://www.nordtheme.com/) (default)
- [`:portal.colors/solarized-dark`](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)
- [`:portal.colors/solarized-light`](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)

Which can be passed as an option to `p/open`:

```clojure
(p/open
  {:portal.colors/theme :portal.colors/nord})
```

## Datafy and Nav

There is one exception to the behavior described above for the UI,
[datafy](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.datafy/datafy) and
[nav](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.datafy/nav). They are extension
points defined in clojure to support user defined logic for transforming
anything into clojure data and how to traverse it.

For a great overview of datafy and nav, I recommend reading [Clojure
1.10's Datafy and Nav](https://corfield.org/blog/2018/12/03/datafy-nav/)
by Sean Corfield.

The below will demonstrate the power of datafy and nav by allowing you to
traverse the hacker news api! It will produce data tagged with metadata on
how to get more data!

```clojure
(require '[examples.hacker-news :as hn])

(tap> hn/stories)
```

An interesting use case for nav is allowing users to nav into keywords to
produce documentation for that keyword. This really highlights the power
behind datafy and nav. It becomes very easy to tailor a browser into the
perfect development environment!

## CLI Usage

To use portal from the cli, do the following depending on your data
format:

```bash
cat deps.edn     | clojure -m portal.main edn
cat package.json | clojure -m portal.main json
cat transit.json | clojure -m portal.main transit
```

I keep the following aliases handy for easier CLI use:

```bash
alias edn='clojure -A:portal -m portal.main edn'
alias json='clojure -A:portal -m portal.main json'
alias transit='clojure -A:portal -m portal.main transit'
```

and often use the `Copy as cURL` feature in the chrome network tab to do
the following:

```
curl ... | transit
```

## Principles

- Support as much of clojure's data as possible
- First class support for async extensibility
- Simple standalone usage without a clojure environment
- Easy theming

## Prior Art

- [clojure.inspector](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.inspector/inspect)
- [REBL](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/REBL-distro)
- [punk](https://github.com/Lokeh/punk)
- [shadow-cljs inspect](https://clojureverse.org/t/introducing-shadow-cljs-inspect/5012)

## Ideas for the Future 

- ~Diff Viewer~
  - Any vector pair can be diffed in portal via [lambdaisland/deep-diff2](https://github.com/lambdaisland/deep-diff2#diffing)
- ~Markdown Viewer~
  - Any string can be viewed as markdown in portal via [yogthos/markdown-clj](https://github.com/yogthos/markdown-clj)
  - Any hiccup data structure can also be viewed as html
- Chart Viewer
- Node+Edge Graphs Viewer

## Development

To start development, do:

    make dev

### Formatting

To format source code, do:

    make fmt

### CI Checks

To run all ci checks, do:

    make ci

### E2E Testing

To run the e2e tests in the jvm, node and web environments, do:

    make e2e

NOTE: these aren't fully automated tests. They depend on a human for
verification and synchronization but it beats having to type everything
out manually into a repl.
