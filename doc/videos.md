</a>

The emergence of visual tools in the Clojure ecosystem has improved the
community's ability to learn about and develop their systems. These tools have
unlocked potential workflows that are still being explored, but not yet widely
adopted.

Exploring and getting the most out of these tools requires collaboration and
investment.

In this talk I share some issues with my previous workflows and how the the
visual tool Portal has improved them. This will demonstrate what's possible, but
also hopefully spark more exploration and collaboration.

What does a typical data analysis workflow look like? .. and what is needed to
make such workflows simple & easy for any person with a data question?

In the talk, we will demonstrate some of the relevant workflows, libraries, and
tools through a real-world data problem.

Portal is a Clojure data visualization and exploration tool aimed at enhancing
interactive development. In this talk we will explore aspects of Portal's
internals and how they enable various types of workflows for different users.
After this talk, you should be better equipped to leverage Portal in your
specific workflow.

## 2022-09-10 - :clojure U 2022: Code execution as data with omni-trace  (by [Lukas Domagala][cyrik])

Our programs and their libraries are becoming more complex every day. Clojure is
a great way to curb that complexity, but at some point, it still becomes
difficult to reason about the flow of data through the application.

Omni-trace makes it possible to visualize that flow and ask questions about any
calls that were made.

In this talk, you will learn how you can use omni-trace to see your code in
action, integrate it into your dev routine, and explore unknown libraries.
Afterward, you'll never want to start a normal debugger again.

Chris Badahdah (https://djblue.github.io/) will be presenting a data
inspection/visualization tool he's been working on over the past year, Portal
(https://github.com/djblue/portal). He hopes it will provide users the ability
to better understand and debug systems by making it easier to explore their data
models.

Demo of Portal by the author Chris Badahdah (https://github.com/djblue) with
appropriate grillings and homework from the panel :)

It's a really great way to explore data that was previously inaccessible. It's
in the same space as Reveal and the closed source REBL from the company formerly
known as Cognitect.

It was streamed live on the [Apropos discord][apropos-discord] server which is open to all.
