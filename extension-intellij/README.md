# Portal Inspector Plugin

<!-- Plugin description -->

A clojure tool to navigate through your data.

This plugin acts as a companion to the main [Portal](https://github.com/djblue/portal) project.
It enables you to host the web based Portal UI inside of Intellij.

The main benefits of using this plugin are:
* Automatic font / theme discovery
* No window management
* Editor specific commands. See: goto-definition in the command palette

Portal itself allows you to pipe data from a clojure repl via [tap&gt;](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/tap%3E) into the various data visualization tools within the Portal UI.

For a more in-depth look into how to use portal, take a look at the project [https://github.com/djblue/portal#api](README)
