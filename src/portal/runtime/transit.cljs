;; Using the normal t/write-meta causes an issue with vars. Since
;; transit-cljs seems to process metadata before custom handlers, the
;; metadata is stripped from the var, rendering the handler useless.
;; Moreover, metadata is then associated with the tagged value, resultsing
;; in issues for consumers because Transit$TaggedValue doesn't implement
;; any metadata protocols. I don't know if this is inteded behavior or a
;; bug, it seems to work without issue for transit-clj.
